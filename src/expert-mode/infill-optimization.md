Infill Optimization
===================

Slic3r contains several advanced infill settings which can help produce
better extrusions.

-   `Infill every n layers` - Will produce sparse vertical infill by
    skipping a set number of layers. This can be used to speed up print
    times where the missing infill is acceptable.

-   `Only infill where needed` - Slic3r will analyse the model and
    choose where infill is required in order to support internal
    ceilings and overhangs. Useful for reducing time and materials.

-   `Solid infill every n layers` - Forces a solid fill pattern on the
    specified layers. Zero will disable this option.

-   `Fill angle` - By default the infill pattern runs at 45Â° to the
    model to provide the best adhesion to wall structures. Infill
    extrusions that run adjacent to perimeters are liable to de-laminate
    under stress. Some models may benefit from rotating the fill angle
    to ensure the optimal direction of the extrusion.

-   `Solid infill threshold area` - Small areas within the model are
    usually best off being filled completely to provide structural
    integrity. This will however take more time and material, and can
    result in parts being unnecessarily solid. Adjust this option to
    balance these needs.

-   `Only retract when crossing perimeters` - Retracting, to prevent
    ooze, is unnecessary if the extruder remains within the boundaries
    of the model. Care should be taken if the print material oozes
    excessively, as not retracting may result in enough material loss to
    affect the quality of the subsequent extrusion. However, most modern
    printers and materials rarely suffer from such extreme ooze
    problems.

-   `Infill before perimeters` - Reverses the order in which the layer
    is printed. Usually the perimeter is laid down initially, followed
    by the infill, and this is usually the preferable as the perimeter
    acts as a wall containing the infill.
