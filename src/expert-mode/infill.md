Infill Patterns and Density
===========================

There are several considerations when choosing an infill pattern: object
strength, time and material, personal preference. It can be inferred
that a more complex pattern will require more moves, and hence take more
time and material.

Slic3r offers several infill patterns, four regular, and three more
exotic flavours. The numbers given in brackets below each figure are a
rough estimate of material used and time taken for a simple 20mm cube
model. Note that this is only indicative, as model complexity and
other factors will affect time and material.

Certain model types are more suited for a particular pattern, for
example organic versus mechanical types. Figure
 shows how a honeycomb fill may
suit this mechanical part better because each hexagon bonds with the
same underlying pattern each layer, forming a strong vertical structure.

Most models require only a low density infill, as providing more than,
say, 50% will produce a very tightly packed model which uses more
material than required. For this reason a common range of patterns is
between 10% and 30%, however the requirements of the model will
determine which density is best. Figure 
shows how the patterns change as the density increases.
